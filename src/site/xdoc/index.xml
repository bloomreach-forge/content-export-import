      <subsection name="What is Hippo Content EXIM (Export / Import)?">
        <p>
          This project is going to provide a higher level feature of Content Import and Export,
          depending on <a href="http://hippo-pojo-bind.forge.onehippo.org/" target="_blank">Hippo JCR POJO Binding</a> library
          (which provides a lower level JCR mapping/binding mechanism only).
        </p>
        <p>
          So, for example, while <a href="http://hippo-pojo-bind.forge.onehippo.org/" target="_blank">Hippo JCR POJO Binding</a> library
          doesn't provide any Hippo Repository Workflow level operations properly,
          this project is going to provide that kind of higher level, that is, Hippo Repository Workflow level,
          Content Import / Export features.
        </p>
        <p>
          TODO: Implement stuffs and cut a release with demo project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stay tuned!
